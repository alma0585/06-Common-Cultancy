        <div>
        <p>February 2023 was the anniversary of the start of the war between Ukraine and Russia. The anniversary seemed to cause a temporary increase in attention to the conflict, despite the otherwise declining focus on the war. Going from almost 600.000 interactions from the public in December 2022, to a little over 1.5 million in February 2023.
            Even though there is a quite big jump from the number of interactions, there is still a big difference from the highest number of interactions in March 2022.  The highest number of interactions is over 7 million, which means there is 366.67% difference between March 2022 and February 2023.</p>

        <p>In the period from June to September 2023, we observed how the world's focus shifted to the rising economic challenges, such as inflation and higher energy prices, which affected many countries because of the war in Ukraine. Which also caused less interaction and interest in the war among the media and the public, creating additional challenges for Ukraine. This made it harder for them to maintain international support in their fight against Russia.</p>

        <h1> October 2023 </h1>
        <div>
        <p>In October 2023, public interest and interactions regarding the war in Ukraine reached their lowest levels since the conflict began in February 2022. Media coverage and public attention largely shifted to other global crises, such as the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, which initiated a new conflict. Interactions related to Ukraine dropped to 232,200, representing a staggering decline of 2.915%. Similarly, the number of posts about Ukraine in October 2023 was at its lowest, with only 966 postsâ€”a decrease of over 1,231% since March 2022. Despite the waning global attention, Ukraine continues to endure relentless Russian missile attacks, further exacerbating its dire humanitarian crisis.</p>

        <p>By the end of December 2023, interest in the conflict in Ukraine continued to decline. Ukraine faced an even bigger struggle to secure international attention and support. Additionally, the United States warned of uncertainties regarding resources for arms deliveries to Ukraine, primarily due to the U.S.'s shifting priorities influenced by the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Amid these new uncertainties, Russia continued to intensify its airstrikes against Ukraine, including an attack on the city of Kherson, which also had severe consequences.</p>
