        <div>
        <p>September 14, 2020, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky approved Ukraine's new national security strategy, which emphasized a partnership with NATO.
            November 10, 2021, the United States reported unusual movements of Russian troops near Ukraine's borders. By November 28, Ukraine had reported a buildup of 92,000 Russian soldiers.
            Joe Biden warned Russia of "strong economic and other measures" if Russia attacked Ukraine.
            Vladimir Putin proposed restrictions on NATO's activities in Eastern Europe, including a prohibition on Ukraine joining NATO. This proposal was rejected by Ukraine.

            <p> January 19, 2022: The United States approved a $200 million security aid package for Ukraine.

                January 24–25, 2022: NATO placed its forces on high alert in response to the increased Russian military presence near Ukraine's borders. Russian military exercises involved approximately 6,000 soldiers and 60 fighter jets in areas close to Ukraine and Crimea.
                A diplomatic crisis unfolded between Russia and the West, eventually leading to Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.

        <h1>February 2022</h1>
        <div>
            <p>On February 21, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics as independent states and deployed troops under the guise of "peacekeeping." On February 24, he launched a "special military operation" in Ukraine, initiating missile strikes and invasions targeting cities like Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odessa.
                By February 25, fighting around Kyiv intensified as Ukrainian forces and civilians mounted strong resistance. On February 28, negotiations near the Belarusian border failed to produce a ceasefire, and the conflict escalated further.
                In February 2022 the interest towards Ukraine starts to increase and over 5.000 post were made related to the Ukraine and Russia conflict and there were also 4 million interactions from the public.

        <h1>February 2023 </h1>
        <div>
        <p>February 2023 was the anniversary of the start of the war between Ukraine and Russia. The anniversary seemed to cause a temporary increase in attention to the conflict, despite the otherwise declining focus on the war. Going from almost 600.000 interactions from the public in December 2022, to a little over 1.5 million in February 2023.
            Even though there is a quite big jump from the number of interactions, there is still a big difference from the highest number of interactions in March 2022.  The highest number of interactions is over 7 million, which means there is 366.67% difference between March 2022 and February 2023.</p>

<img class="crises-gif" src="crises.gif">
        <p>In the period from June to September 2023, we observed how the world's focus shifted to the rising economic challenges, such as inflation and higher energy prices, which affected many countries because of the war in Ukraine. Which also caused less interaction and interest in the war among the media and the public, creating additional challenges for Ukraine. This made it harder for them to maintain international support in their fight against Russia.</p>

        <h1> October 2023 </h1>
        <div>
        <p>In October 2023, public interest and interactions regarding the war in Ukraine reached their lowest levels since the conflict began in February 2022. Media coverage and public attention largely shifted to other global crises, such as the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, which initiated a new conflict. Interactions related to Ukraine dropped to 232,200, representing a staggering decline of 2.915%. Similarly, the number of posts about Ukraine in October 2023 was at its lowest, with only 966 posts—a decrease of over 1,231% since March 2022. Despite the waning global attention, Ukraine continues to endure relentless Russian missile attacks, further exacerbating its dire humanitarian crisis.</p>

        <p>By the end of December 2023, interest in the conflict in Ukraine continued to decline. Ukraine faced an even bigger struggle to secure international attention and support. Additionally, the United States warned of uncertainties regarding resources for arms deliveries to Ukraine, primarily due to the U.S.'s shifting priorities influenced by the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Amid these new uncertainties, Russia continued to intensify its airstrikes against Ukraine, including an attack on the city of Kherson, which also had severe consequences.</p>
